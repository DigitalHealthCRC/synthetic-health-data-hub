# GDPR Compliance for Synthetic Health Data

## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union's comprehensive data protection law. Understanding how GDPR applies to synthetic health data is crucial for organizations operating in or serving EU residents.

## Key GDPR Principles

### Lawful Basis for Processing
Synthetic data generation may rely on:
- **Legitimate Interest**: Research and development
- **Public Interest**: Healthcare improvement
- **Consent**: When using identifiable source data

### Data Minimization
- Generate only necessary synthetic records
- Remove unnecessary attributes
- Limit scope to intended use case

### Privacy by Design
- Build privacy into synthesis process
- Default to maximum privacy settings
- Document privacy measures

## GDPR and Synthetic Data

### When is Synthetic Data "Anonymous"?

Under GDPR, data is anonymous if:
1. **No re-identification possible** - Even with additional information
2. **Irreversible process** - Cannot reconstruct original
3. **No individual singling out** - Cannot identify specific persons

### Recital 26 Interpretation
> "The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information... which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person"

## Compliance Requirements

### Risk Assessment
Conduct thorough assessment of:
- Re-identification risk
- Inference attacks
- Membership disclosure
- Auxiliary information risks

### Documentation Requirements
Maintain records of:
- Synthesis methodology
- Privacy guarantees
- Risk assessments
- Data processing activities

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
Required when:
- Processing health data at scale
- Using new technologies
- High risk to individuals

## Best Practices

### Technical Measures
1. **Differential Privacy**: Formal mathematical guarantees
2. **Aggregation**: Minimum group sizes
3. **Noise Addition**: Statistical perturbation
4. **K-Anonymity**: Minimum equivalence classes

### Organizational Measures
1. **Access Controls**: Limit who can generate synthetic data
2. **Audit Trails**: Log all synthesis activities
3. **Training**: Ensure staff understand privacy
4. **Governance**: Clear policies and procedures

## Practical Checklist

- [ ] Document lawful basis for processing
- [ ] Conduct re-identification risk assessment
- [ ] Implement privacy-preserving techniques
- [ ] Complete DPIA if required
- [ ] Establish retention policies
- [ ] Create transparency documentation
- [ ] Implement security measures
- [ ] Train relevant staff
- [ ] Regular compliance reviews
- [ ] Incident response plan

## Special Considerations for Health Data

### Article 9 - Special Categories
Health data requires additional protection:
- Explicit consent or other exception
- Appropriate safeguards
- Member state derogations

### Research Exemption
Article 89 provides flexibility for:
- Scientific research
- Public health purposes
- Statistical purposes

## Case Examples

### Compliant Approach
```
1. Source data: Minimized, lawfully obtained
2. Method: Differential privacy with Îµ=1.0
3. Validation: No re-identification possible
4. Documentation: Full audit trail
5. Result: Anonymous synthetic data
```

### Non-Compliant Risks
```
1. Direct copy with names removed
2. High fidelity without privacy guarantees
3. No risk assessment conducted
4. Potential for re-identification
5. Result: Still personal data under GDPR
```

## Conclusion

Properly implemented synthetic health data can be GDPR compliant as anonymous data. Key requirements:
1. Strong privacy guarantees
2. Thorough risk assessment
3. Proper documentation
4. Ongoing compliance monitoring
