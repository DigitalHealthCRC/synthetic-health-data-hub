# Privacy & Security

Comprehensive resources on privacy preservation techniques and security considerations for synthetic health data.

## Overview

Privacy and security are fundamental to synthetic health data. This section provides deep technical guidance on privacy-preserving methods, security best practices, and risk assessment frameworks to ensure synthetic data maintains strong privacy guarantees.

## Core Topics

### [Privacy Methods](/privacy-security/methods/)
Technical approaches to privacy:
- Differential privacy
- k-anonymity and variants
- Statistical disclosure control
- Cryptographic techniques

### [Security Practices](/privacy-security/security/)
Protecting synthetic data systems:
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Secure computation
- Infrastructure security

### [Risk Assessment](/privacy-security/risk/)
Evaluating privacy risks:
- Re-identification risk
- Membership inference
- Attribute disclosure
- Model inversion attacks

### [Validation Frameworks](/privacy-security/validation/)
Ensuring privacy guarantees:
- Privacy metrics
- Attack simulations
- Certification processes
- Continuous monitoring

## Key Concepts

### Privacy Guarantees

**Differential Privacy**
- Mathematical framework
- Epsilon-delta parameters
- Composition theorems
- Practical implementations

**Statistical Privacy**
- Distribution matching
- Correlation preservation
- Outlier handling
- Noise injection

### Security Architecture

**System Design**
- Zero-trust principles
- Defense in depth
- Secure enclaves
- Federated approaches

**Data Governance**
- Access policies
- Data lineage
- Retention policies
- Incident response

## Quick Reference

| Method | Privacy Level | Utility Trade-off | Use Case |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Differential Privacy | Strong | High | Regulatory compliance |
| k-Anonymity | Moderate | Low | Basic de-identification |
| Secure Multi-party | Strong | Medium | Collaborative analysis |
| Homomorphic Encryption | Very Strong | Very High | Computation on encrypted data |

## Best Practices

1. **Privacy by Design** - Build privacy into the system architecture
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of protection
3. **Regular Audits** - Continuous validation of guarantees
4. **Transparency** - Clear documentation of methods
