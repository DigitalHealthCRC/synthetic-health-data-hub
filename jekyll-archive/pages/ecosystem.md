# Software Ecosystem

Explore the comprehensive landscape of synthetic health data tools, from open-source libraries to enterprise platforms.

## Overview

The synthetic health data ecosystem includes a diverse range of tools and platforms designed to meet different needs - from research prototypes to production-ready systems. This section helps you navigate the options and choose the right solution for your use case.

## Categories

### [Open Source Tools](/ecosystem/open-source/)
Community-driven projects and libraries:
- SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)
- Synthea
- CTGAN
- DataSynthesizer

### [Commercial Solutions](/ecosystem/commercial/)
Enterprise platforms and services:
- Privacy-preserving platforms
- Cloud-based solutions
- Healthcare-specific tools

### [Integrations & Frameworks](/ecosystem/integrations/)
Tools for integrating synthetic data into workflows:
- MLOps integration
- Data pipeline tools
- API services

## Tool Comparison

| Tool | Type | Primary Use Case | Privacy Method |
|------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| SDV | Open Source | General tabular data | Statistical |
| Synthea | Open Source | Patient records | Rule-based |
| CTGAN | Open Source | Complex distributions | GAN-based |

## Selection Guide

Choosing the right tool depends on:
1. **Data complexity** - Simple tabular vs. complex relational
2. **Privacy requirements** - Statistical vs. differential privacy
3. **Scale** - Research prototype vs. production system
4. **Integration needs** - Standalone vs. integrated solution
