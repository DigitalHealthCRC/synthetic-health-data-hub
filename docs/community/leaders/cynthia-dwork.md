## Biography

Professor Cynthia Dwork is renowned for her foundational work in differential privacy, a mathematical framework that has become the gold standard for privacy-preserving data analysis. Her work has profound implications for synthetic health data generation, providing formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data utility.

## Key Contributions

### Differential Privacy (2006)
Co-invented the concept of differential privacy with Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim, and Adam Smith. This framework provides:
- Mathematical privacy guarantees
- Composition theorems
- Practical implementation methods

### Healthcare Applications
Her work enables:
- Privacy-preserving health statistics
- Secure data sharing protocols
- Synthetic data with formal guarantees

## Selected Publications

1. **"Calibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data Analysis"** (2006)
   - Foundational differential privacy paper
   - Introduced the Laplace mechanism

2. **"The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy"** (2014)
   - Comprehensive textbook on differential privacy
   - Co-authored with Aaron Roth

## Notable Quotes

> "Differential privacy is a definition, not an algorithm. It's a criterion that an algorithm must satisfy."

> "Privacy is not about hiding wrongdoing, but about ensuring that innocent behaviors are not misinterpreted."
