# Getting Started with Synthetic Health Data

## Introduction

Synthetic health data is artificially generated data that maintains the statistical properties and patterns of real healthcare data while protecting patient privacy. This guide will help you understand the fundamentals and get started with generating your own synthetic health datasets.

## Why Synthetic Health Data?

### Key Benefits

- **Privacy Protection**: No real patient information is exposed
- **Unlimited Data**: Generate as much data as needed for testing and development
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements while enabling data sharing
- **Innovation**: Enable AI/ML development without privacy concerns

### Common Use Cases

1. **Research & Development**
   - Algorithm testing and validation
   - Statistical analysis
   - Hypothesis generation

2. **Education & Training**
   - Medical education
   - Data science courses
   - Hands-on workshops

3. **Software Development**
   - Testing healthcare applications
   - Load testing systems
   - UI/UX development

4. **Collaboration**
   - Cross-institutional research
   - Industry partnerships
   - Open science initiatives

## Core Concepts

### Types of Synthetic Data

1. **Fully Synthetic**: All records are artificially generated
2. **Partially Synthetic**: Some attributes replaced with synthetic values
3. **Hybrid**: Combination of real and synthetic records

### Key Properties

- **Statistical Fidelity**: Maintains distributions and relationships
- **Privacy Preservation**: Cannot identify individuals
- **Utility**: Useful for intended purpose
- **Scalability**: Can generate any volume needed

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Define Your Requirements

Before generating synthetic data, consider:

- What type of health data do you need?
- What statistical properties must be preserved?
- What privacy level is required?
- What will the data be used for?

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach

#### For Beginners: SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)

The easiest way to start:

```python
from sdv.single_table import GaussianCopulaSynthesizer
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('health_records.csv')

# Create and train synthesizer
synthesizer = GaussianCopulaSynthesizer()
synthesizer.fit(data)

# Generate synthetic data
synthetic_data = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=1000)
```

#### For Advanced Users: CTGAN

For complex datasets with better quality:

```python
from sdv.single_table import CTGANSynthesizer

synthesizer = CTGANSynthesizer(
    epochs=300,
    batch_size=500,
    cuda=True  # Use GPU if available
)
synthesizer.fit(data)
synthetic_data = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=1000)
```

### Step 3: Validate Your Data

Always validate synthetic data before use:

1. **Statistical Validation**
   ```python
   from sdv.evaluation.single_table import evaluate_quality
   
   quality_report = evaluate_quality(
       real_data=data,
       synthetic_data=synthetic_data
   )
   ```

2. **Privacy Validation**
   - Check for unique combinations
   - Verify no real records are duplicated
   - Test re-identification risk

3. **Utility Validation**
   - Run your intended analyses
   - Compare results with real data
   - Verify clinical validity

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Start with simple methods before trying complex ones
- ✅ Always validate privacy and utility
- ✅ Document your generation process
- ✅ Consider regulatory requirements
- ✅ Test on small datasets first

### Don'ts
- ❌ Assume synthetic equals anonymous
- ❌ Skip validation steps
- ❌ Use without understanding limitations
- ❌ Ignore rare events or edge cases
- ❌ Forget about temporal relationships

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Simple Patient Demographics

```python
import pandas as pd
from sdv.single_table import GaussianCopulaSynthesizer

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [25, 30, 45, 50, 65],
    'gender': ['M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M'],
    'blood_pressure': [120, 110, 140, 130, 150]
})

# Generate synthetic data
synthesizer = GaussianCopulaSynthesizer()
synthesizer.fit(data)
synthetic = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=100)
```

### Example 2: Time Series Health Data

```python
from sdv.sequential import PARSynthesizer

# For sequential data like patient visits
synthesizer = PARSynthesizer(
    entity_columns=['patient_id'],
    sequence_columns=['visit_date']
)
synthesizer.fit(visits_data)
synthetic_visits = synthesizer.sample(num_entities=50)
```
