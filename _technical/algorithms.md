# Generation Algorithms

State-of-the-art algorithms for creating synthetic health data with various privacy and utility trade-offs.

## Algorithm Categories

### Statistical Methods
Traditional approaches based on statistical modeling:
- Parametric methods
- Bayesian networks
- Copula-based methods

### Deep Learning Methods
Neural network-based generation:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Diffusion models

### Privacy-Preserving Methods
Algorithms with formal privacy guarantees:
- Differential privacy mechanisms
- Secure multi-party computation
- Federated learning approaches
